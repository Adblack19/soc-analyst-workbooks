# Credential Hunting & Crypto Mining Suitability – SOC Workbook
history | grep pass
### Command
history | grep pass

### What it Does
Searches command history for password-related commands.

### Why Attackers Use It
- Recover plaintext passwords accidentally typed by admins
- Identify credentials used in scripts

### Example
history | grep ssh

### SOC Detection
- Strong post-exploitation behavior
- Rare in legitimate workflows
find / -name .env / id_rsa
### Commands
find / -name .env  
find /home -name id_rsa  

### What They Do
Search filesystem for environment files and SSH private keys.

### Why Attackers Use Them
- .env often stores secrets
- id_rsa provides SSH persistence and lateral movement

### SOC Detection
- High-risk indicator
- Combine with file access telemetry
cat /proc/cpuinfo, lscpu, free -m, htop
### Commands
cat /proc/cpuinfo  
lscpu | grep Model  
free -m  
top  
htop  

### Why Attackers Use Them
- Evaluate cryptomining profitability
- Decide whether to deploy miners

### SOC Detection
- Often precedes miner deployment
